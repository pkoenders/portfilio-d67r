              <p>
                I have an interest in and support digital accessibility. Accessibility does not
                happen by accident. It has to be purposefully planned, built, and tested.
                Inaccessible websites deprive users with disabilities of experiences and
                opportunities that other people take for granted.{' '}

                identify themselves as having a disability. It does not make sense to ignore these
                users. An accessible website is inclusive. Is your website accessible?

                <a href="https://webaim.org/">WebAIM</a> recognises the framework I use as the most

                progressive page enhancement and a built-in linting tool to find accessibility
                errors. Help make the web work for everyone.

                website is utilising <a href="https://prismic.io/">Prismic CMS</a> to manage
                content. Prismic is cost-effective and has a great user onboarding and experience
                for content creators, designers and developers. Prismic empowers content creators to
                develop and publish websites without constraints in locales of their choice. Create

                I use <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> to generate static HTML at build
                time. No server and no reachable database equals no malicious requests, DDOS attacks
                or accidental exposure. Your website attack surface will be low to non-existent.

              <p>
                I design and develop websites for a global CDN that don't require complex scaling
                operations or expensive hosting plans. They scale when needed, but when traffic
                drops, so does your usage — and your costs. Host your website for less (cheaper than
                Wix, WordPress and Squarespace) and use less energy. If you plan to administer your
                website on your own and have a low traffic, you could be hosting for free. It's a
                more brilliant choice for the conscious who consider responsible hosting with lower
                costs and a carbon footprint!

                You will get personal support, and I respond to requests because I simply ❤️what I
                do.
