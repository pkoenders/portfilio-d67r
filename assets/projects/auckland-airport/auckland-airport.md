<div class="description">

Auckland Airport Concierge Service is a module add-on incorporated into their existing website.

I created wireframes, user flows and hi definition designs for stakeholders.

I also worked on the front end, building HTML/LESS templates and defining responsive layouts for the Auckland Airports site redesign.
