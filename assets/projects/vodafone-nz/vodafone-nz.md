    intro: UI design refresh of new digital brand guidelines.
---

<div class="description">

Implemented a UI design refresh of new digital brand guidelines across legacy pages.

Re-design and rebuild web pages, journeys, components and assets.

I created the designs ensuring brand guidelines are adhered to. Deliverables included design files and components, presented for a range of screen sizing and collaborate with stakeholders.

**Challenges**<br />
No shared resource for designers to draw from.

**Solution**<br />
I designed, built and managed pattern library and style guide. Ensured brand and style consistency, allowing the design team to use consistent components from a shared source.
