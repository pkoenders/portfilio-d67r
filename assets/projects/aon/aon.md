<div class="description">

A design project for AON Insurance helping bring their products online.

I designed the wireframes, user flows, hi definition mocks and HTML prototypes for their stakeholders. I was also asked to create HTML templates for their integration team.

The client asked that web accessibility be a focus adhering to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) for AA colour contrast and keyboard navigation.
