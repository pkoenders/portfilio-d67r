    intro: A portfolio website designed and built for a portrait artist.

**Project**<br />
A portfolio design and build for a portrait artist. Displaying the artwork at its best, fitting the browser window where possible and the ability to zoom on images was the client request/requirement.

**Challenges**<br />
The client also requested a straightforward, easy to use Content Management System as the technical skills of the client are proudly not the best. The client also required that the new website images should load quickly and have a traditional gallery view option.

**Solution**<br />
Gatsby is a framework for building static websites that optimise images and load quickly. It was the start of a global lockdown and I knew it was a good chance to pick up and learn a new tool.

**Stack**<br />
Gatsby (React, HTML, SCSS & API's) and DatoCMS.

Peter has created two websites for me. The original one, using a standardised commercial template, was great, but the new one is superior in every way.

Using a template Peter has designed himself, my new website feels individually tailor made to showcase my portrait work.

The viewer is more immediately engaged with the images in a dynamic and more interactive way.

The website downloads incredibly quickly.

And maybe best of all Peter has made the administration side of the website super easy. Now, even a techno luddite like me can control and edit most of the material myself, which I definitely couldn’t do before. **Very empowering!**

Thanks Peter for my new website! I’m so thrilled with it.
