<div class="description">

ASB bank Single Sign On for their banking products. The vision from ASB was to have a consistent UI login experience across their products. The login re-design had minimal disruption to their users and Call Centre.

I created wireframes, user flows and hi definition mocks for stakeholders. HTML prototypes were also created for their integration team.
