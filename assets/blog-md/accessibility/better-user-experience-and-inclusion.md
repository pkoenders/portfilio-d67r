<h3>Reviewing the Impact of Accessible Design</h3>

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 is an internationally recognised standard for individuals, organisations and governments created by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The document describes how to make digital content more accessible for people with a wide range of impairments and help to improve usability.<sup>1</sup>

The WCAG is built around four core principles of accessibility; Perceivable, Operable, Understandable and Robustness. Each principle has a layer of guidance and success criteria that must be achieved to conform to the standard. Content in a digital interface must be presented in a manner that a user can recognise. The user must also be able to operate and interact. Operation of the interface must be understandable for the user and be robust enough to be interpreted by user agents and assistive technologies.<sup>2</sup>

Digital interfaces are an all-important means to access many interactions and resources of our lives. They are used to gaining access to healthcare, government and education services, also employment, purchasing and entertainment. We all have the right to access these services and it is vital they are accessible.

Although a digital interface is a convenience for most of us, it can be a hindrance for impaired users. The benefits of an accessible interface can limit digital obstacles and enhance assistive technologies. A provider that delivers accessible content will assist more people while delivering a better user experience, also provide equal access to opportunities and resources to those whom might otherwise be excluded or marginalised. Promote diversity, independence, inclusion and help build better relationships.

We all benefit from a digital interface that is universal and it is the right thing to do.
