<h3>Test for Accessibility</h3>

The combination of Axe, Wave, Lighthouse and colour contrast accessibility tools are now an essential part of my web designer and developer toolkit. Using these tools assists in creating a solid foundation for a robust design and webpage structure, greater performance and implementation of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines<sup>1</sup> core principles of accessibility requirements.

**Benefits**<br>
The utilisation of semi-automated testing tools as part of the design and development process has numerous benefits and draw attention to usability from an accessible perspective. These tools can quickly locate issues and reduce the time it takes to manually inspect a page. They assist with correcting accessibility issues by catching errors and providing a description, an impact status and more information to help inform and educate for best practices. This contributes to building a more accessible and semantic design, HTML, JavaScript, style and content structure.

**Limitations**<br>
While semi-automated testing tools are part of a toolkit, they are not a solution and should not be used as a sole reliance for digital accessibility compliance. Human interaction is required to insure there is a logical flow and meaning of content. A tab order follows an expected path. Keyboard access can only be confirmed by a human input and alternative text attributes should be in a relevant context.<sup>2</sup>

However, semi-automated tools are necessary for efficient accessibility evaluation and reducing digital barriers. The tools contribute to creating to an overall better framework and experience not only for users, but all stakeholders and help make the web work for everyone.
